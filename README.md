# DrowsinessDetector
In this project, I used OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and fed them into a Deep Learning model, which will then classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The approach I used for this project is as follows : 
 Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera.  
 Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest and detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier .  
 Step 3 – Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed and finally calculate the score to check whether the person is drowsy or not.
