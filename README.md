# DrowsinessDetector
In this project, I used OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and fed them into a Deep Learning model, which will then classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The approach I used for this project is first I took image as input from a camera. Then detected the face in the image and created a Region of Interest and detected the eyes from ROI and fed it to the classifier. The classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed and finally calculate the score to check whether the person is drowsy or not.
