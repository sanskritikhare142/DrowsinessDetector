# DrowsinessDetector
In this project, I used OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and fed them into a Deep Learning model, which will then classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’.
 The approach I used for this project is as follows : 
 Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera.  
 Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest .  
 Step 3 – Detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier.
 Step 4 – Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.
 Step 5 – Calculate score to check whether the person is drowsy or not.
